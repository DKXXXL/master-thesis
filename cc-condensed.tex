\noindentparagraph{Consistency.}
One of the most fundamental properties of a dependent type theory is consistency.
\begin{theorem}[Consistency]
\label{thm:consistency}
  The typing judgment $\goodTerm{\cdot}{t}{\bot}$ is not derivable for any term~$t$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
Consistency says that the type $\bot$ is not inhabited.
Thus, it is safe to use the type theory for logical reasoning, as not
every proposition is trivially provable.
\cref{thm:consistency} is a consequence of a meta\-circular interpretation of all
the well-formedness rules, which, in particular, interprets $\bot$ in
\TT as an uninhabited type in the meta\-language.
The construction of this interpretation follows the standard model of
\citet{altkap2016}, extending it to handle linkages.
Linkages~$\LkgAdd{\lkg}{t}$ can be interpreted into non-dependent products,
as rule \ruleref{l/add} indicates.

We refer the reader to a supplemental file (in Agda syntax) for the complete proof.

\noindentparagraph{Canonicity.}

A second property we prove is canonicity.

\begin{theorem}[Canonicity]
\label{thm:canonicity}
  If $\goodTerm{\cdot}{t}{\cB}$, then either $\goodTerm{\cdot}{t \equiv \true}{\cB}$ or $\goodTerm{\cdot}{t \equiv \false}{\cB}$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
This canonicity theorem says that every closed term of the ground
type~$\cB$ is convertible to one of the canonical forms $\true$ and~$\false$.
When proved in a constructive meta\-logic, the proof of canonicity
amounts to a normalization function for closed terms of the ground type.
So canonicity serves to justify the computational nature of the type theory.

We prove \cref{thm:canonicity} by constructing a logical-relations model
for the well-formedness rules, following prior approaches~\cite{coquand2018canonicity,sterling2019algebraic,kaposi2019gluing}.
In particular, a closed, well formed type $\goodType{\cdot}{T}{}$ is interpreted
into a logical predicate on closed terms: the predicate includes all
closed, reducible terms of type~$T$.
The proof is available as a supplemental file in Agda syntax.
