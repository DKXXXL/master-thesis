When adapting Family Polymorphism into dependent type, we choose to shrink and focus on only the essence of family (and inheritance) structure in \citet{zm2017}, and thus a lot of unrelated feature, like Interface, will be tailored. In this case, it will look like module with late-binding and inheritance as code reuse for module. 

We also need it to have a good compatibility with Inductive Type, because we don't want to lose too much reasoning power of Coq.
