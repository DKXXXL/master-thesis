We start with the formulation of the syntax, which is based on the formalization of a predicative \textit{Martin-Lof Type Theory} (MLTT) given by~\citet{coquand2018canonicity}. Thus we will omit a great deal of details about MLTT here but focus on the new facility we introduced. 

Though phrased in Latex, we are following~\citet{altkap2016} to use as
our meta-logic a type theoretical framework (like Agda), 
together with \textit{Quotient Inductive Inductive Type} (QIIT). Each
judgement will actually be represented by a QIIT type, which are
mutually recursively defined together. Quotient is used to represent
judgemental(definitional) equality, thanks to which we can have a
concise representation. This way, for all four kinds of judgement we are
using, there are always equality among these data. Doing so, we can omit
some obvious equality judgement. Most of the reasoning can be formulated
using the \textit{algebra} of QIIT (mapping out function from this
quotient data-type). 

We also highlight some special feature in this style of formulation of dependent type theory: 1. this modern formulation of type theory does't have operational semantic but only equality 
%We will recover canonicity afterwards, which implies the computational ability of our theory. 
;
2. instead of using meta-level substitution, we use explicit substitution and de Bruijn indices in our intrinsic formulation. This is also called substitution calculus in the literature and is favoured due to its clear categorical semantic; 
3. we are dealing with quotient data, so we are actually manipulating equivalence classes of terms. 

We will write out the syntax of the whole type theory for completeness.
