We follow \citep{sterling2019algebraic,coquand2018canonicity} to construct the canonicity model. We will first specify the formulation of the basic canonicity theorem. 

We will resort to both conventional math notation and Agda syntax to explain the main idea of canonicity model. 


% After gluing, we figure out the following "canonicity" theorem as well
% the canonical form of inductive type, linkage and boolean
