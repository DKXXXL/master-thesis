%

For accessibility of the main text, \cref{sec:metatheory2} presents \TT using
named variables and meta-level substitution.
For clarity of proof details, a technical appendix supplementing
\cref{sec:metatheory2} instead uses \citeauthor{debruijn1964} indices and explicit substitution \cite{abadi1989subst}.
%
We acknowledge that the presentation is dense for an audience
without intimate knowledge of MLTT, so we summarize the salient points first.

\noindentparagraph{Summary.}

\TT is intended as a foundational model. So unlike our programmer-facing plugin,
%typing is structural rather than nominal\EDJ{I don't actually know what do you mean by structural here. I think surface syntax (Coq) is pretty structual as well.}, and
fields automatically axiomatized by the plugin require explicit definitions in \TT.
%
\TT provides MLTT-style constructs that can be used to express families and
family polymorphism. %rather than building it in directly.
%
Most notably, it extends MLTT with what we call \emph{linkages}.
Linkages are a namesake of the theoretical device through which \citet{zm2017} model
family polymorphism in an OO setting, but the technical details differ significantly from the prior work.

\begin{itemize}
[labelsep=*,leftmargin=1pc,itemsep=3pt]
\item 
Linkages model families, so they are like tuples composed of fields
(with field names represented by variable bindings).
But there is a twist: linkages support late binding.
Unlike dependent tuples where a later component is \emph{existentially}
quantified over the earlier ones, a linkage component is \emph{universally}
quantified over---and thus polymorphic to---the components preceding it.%\Zhixuan{explain the intuition behind the (typing rule of) linkages, and try to connect it to the ``family'' in the earlier section/surface syntax}\EDJreply{I am not sure if more is needed because the section ``Family polymorphism via linkages'' is trying to do this. Maybe I should estabilish connection between Rule l/add with the compilation process of fam poly?}\YZreply{I don't think you should mention anything about compilation process here. The surface syntax? Maybe. But I prefer not changing this sentence; it's supposed to be an executive summary rather than a detailed explanation.}\EDJreply{Actually I current am not sure where to add more sentences and how to elaborate more. Except for mentioning compilation process I don't think I have any good idea. So I will just stop here.}

\item
\TT features \emph{linkage transformers}, which model how a family can be
inductively constructed by inheriting fields from another family,
adding new fields, and overriding existing fields.
\item
Inductive types are modeled as W-types~\cite{martin1984intuitionistic} and their
extension as overriding.

\item
Consistency and canonicity of \TT are proved by giving semantic interpretations to the syntactic typing judgments.
\end{itemize}

%\TT supports extending inductive types through
%formation rules that enable the encoding of the further binding of W-types~\cite{martin1984intuitionistic} in linkages.

%Also unlike our plugin, \TT does not feature automations such as
%the generation of propositional equalities and partial recursors,
%but it is expressive enough to encode their definitions.

\noindentparagraph{Brief review of MLTT.}

\cref{fig:mltt-selected} presents the syntax and selected typing rules of MLTT %(predicative) MLTT
(and \cref{fig:fmltt-selected} \TT).
Dependent function types \nTyPi{x}{A}{B},
dependent pair types \nTySigma{x}{A}{B}, and
identity types \TyId{t_1}{t_2} are standard.
So are their introduction and elimination forms.
We use based path induction%
\defcitealias{program2013homotopy}{UFP~2013}%
as the elimination principle for identity types~\citepalias{program2013homotopy}.
Capture-avoiding substitution is notated $\bullet[\bullet/x]$.
We use $x$ and $\mathit{self}$ to denote variables.
A singleton type $\TyS{t}$ helps expose the definition of a term~$t$
in its type (rule \ruleref{tm/s})~\cite{aspinall1995singleton,stone2000}.
Definitional equalities have the forms %(for each judgement)
\goodCtx{\Gm_1 \equiv \Gm_2}{},
\goodType{\Gm}{T_1 \equiv T_2}{},
\goodTerm{\Gm}{t_1 \equiv t_2}{T},
etc.
Following \citet{altkap2016}, we regard our (intrinsically typed) syntax
as being quotiented by these equalities.
Quotienting facilitates coercion along equalities---given
\goodCtx{\Gm_1 \equiv \Gm_2}{} and
\goodType{\Gm_1}{T_1 \equiv T_2}{},
the derivation of \goodTerm{\Gm_1}{t}{T_1} is considered definitionally equal to
a derivation of \goodTerm{\Gm_2}{t}{T_2}. %\YZ{Is this accurate??}\EDJreply{Yes. In QIIT model, it looks like `t : Tm G1 T1' and  `t : Tm G2 T2'. In extenional Agda, because ``G1 = G2'', ``T1 = T2'', thus the two types `Tm G2 T2 = Tm G1 T1'. So they are the same derivation in QIIT. In our setup, we have the same idea, because after quotient, G1 refers to same object as G2, so the derivation is the same.}
%\YZ{should there be a convertibility rule?}\EDJreply{in this style, the quotient by judgemental equality is applied, so A is equal to B even in meta-logic, which means t : A is the same as t : B. Maybe this is something require emphasis? Because it is usually handled by LF (like QIIT) but now we are using bare hands so.... maybe we need to emphasize this}
%For each derivation (of each judgment)\YZ{I don't get what 'each derivation' or 'each judgment' means}\EDJreply{(G |- t : T), which looks like (t : Tm G T) in QIIT/Agda is the derivation; so basically the term is the derivation (or proof), the types (Tm G T) is the judgement. It applies to each kind of judgement, for example, (G |- ), which looks like (G : Con), (G |-) is the derivation and (_ |- )is the judgement \\ 
%Note that without referring to QIIT/Agda, the definition of judgement and derivation is still clear -- (G |- _ : T) is a judgement and a concrete proof/derivation we get for t like (G |- t : T) is the derivation. Similar for ( _ |- ) vs. (G |-) and (G |- _ ) vs (G |- T). \\ 
%I think in intrinsic typing, knowing t and knowing (G |- t : T) is exactly the same (i.e. there are no two different derivations lead to the same t; for each t, there is only one derivation for it). This is not true for extrinsic typing. \\
%If this prequisite knowledge is too involved, feel free to delete this sentence, I think I just want to say there are equality/quotient everywhere between all kinds of derivations(proof?data?) -- equality between terms, types, substitutions, contexts, linkage signatures ...\\
%I think this is something standard from Martin Lof, since Martin Lof is the first guy talk about judgement.
%}

We use universes à la \citet{coquand2013presheaf}, following \citet{kaposi2019gluing}.
Unlike Russell-style ones, these universes are not inhabited by types directly,
but rather by the \emph{codes} of types,
and arguably behave better due to its closeness to Tarski-style universes~\cite{luo2012notes}. 
% and compatibility with our algebraic formulation of MLTT~\cite{coquand2018canonicity}. % I am not sure if I want this sentence or not
Term $\codety{T}$ encodes type~$T$ (\ruleref{tm/c}) and thus inhabits universe~$\cU$.
Type $\El{t}$ decodes term~$t$ (\ruleref{ty/el}).
%\footnote{By contrast,  Russel-style universes are inhabited by types directly.  Tarski-style universes are ``semantically more fundamental'' \cite{luo2012notes} and friendlier to our meta-theoretical reasoning.}
There is an infinite hierarchy of universes;
we omit universe levels in the presentation to avoid clutter.
%\rA{Why is W(t) a term and not a type?}\YZreply{I think the reviewer is wondering what is gained by encoding and decoding types, compared to types directly inhabiting universes.}

% We use intrinsically typed syntax \cite{church1940}---terms and types are well-formed by construction.
For concision, typing rules omit obvious premises required for well-formedness.
For example, \ruleref{tm/lam} implicitly requires $\goodCtx{\Gm}{}$
(i.e., that the context be well-typed).

%We briefly review the base MLTT fragment first.
%
% In keeping with the recent trend~\cite{altkap2016,coquand2018canonicity,gratzer-sterling-birkedal-2019}\YZ{Does coquand2018canonicity really use explicit subst?}\EDJreply{Yes it is. Look at Section 2.1. When he starts reasoning, he actually deals with category with family (instead of the typing rules), where he consider morphism between contexts, which is substitution. But I agree it can be a bit ambiguous to see (because he literally show two version of MLTT without connecting them---one classical typing rule version, the other directly works on Category with Family (CwF)) but since his proof is mainly on Category with Family, so it counts as explicit substitution. But if you are concerned, we can change to Andras Kovacs "Generalized Universe Hierarchies and First-Class Universe Levels". or Andreas Abel's "Decidability of Conversion for Type Theory in Type Theory". The former one directly work on CwF, the latter one include substitution as part of the raw syntax.}
% in MLTT presentations, we use \emph{explicit substitutions}~\cite{substcalculus,abadi1989subst}:
% substitutions~$\gm$ and their applications (e.g., \sub{T}{\gm}) are part
% of the syntax rather than meta-operations.
%
% Variables are in the form of \citeauthor{debruijn1964} indices:
% \var{n} is the variable bound by the $n$-th closest enclosing binder.
% For example, $\lambda x.\,\lambda y.\,x$ is $\lam{\lam{\var{1}}}$.
%
% Substitutions are typed with the form 
%\EDJ{It seems to me G |- g : D is a judgement not a rule. Rules usually have two parts (premises + conclusion). Judgment is a standard terminology invented by Martin Lof (https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/judgment see reference here). I will suggest saying 'Formation rules for substitution lead to a judgement G |- g : D' sth like this. In pen-and-paper, the formation rule (corresponding to QIIT well-typed-ness of judgement) is called presuppose (can be found in Modal MLTT paper) }
% $\goodSub{\Gm}{\gm}{\Dl}$.
% The idea is that applying~$\gm$ to terms valid in the context~$\Dl$
% yields terms valid in~$\Gm$ (\ruleref{tm/sub} and \ruleref{ty/sub}).
% %
% The two main forms of substitutions are weakening (\ruleref{sub/wk}) and extension (\ruleref{sub/ext}):
% \sub{t}{\SubstWeak{n}} introduces $n$ free variables into the context of $t$, and
% \sub{t}{\SubstExt{\gm}{t'}} substitutes~$t'$ for~$\var{0}$ in~$t$ and
% then applies~$\gm$.
% For example, rule \ruleref{tm/snd} states that if $t$ is a dependent pair
% that has type $\TySigma{A}{B}$, then $\snd{t}$ has type
% $\sub{B}{\SubstExt{\SubstWeak{0}}{\fst{t}}}$,
% where $\SubstId$ is the identity substitution (\ruleref{sub/id}).

\noindentparagraph{Introducing and eliminating inductive types.}

% TODO: Remove mentioning conventional Wtype here

W-types~\cite{martin1984intuitionistic} are a succinct way to model
inductive types in MLTT.
Together with the identity type, they can express a whole host of inductive
types~\cite{hugunin2021not}, including those with multiple constructors.

Our formulation of W-types differs from previous ones in that it is
straightforward to identify constructors from what we call \emph{W-type signatures}.
%
A signature $\goodWSig{\Gm}{\wsig}{n}$ is
composed of $n$ pairs of types (\ruleref{wsig/empty} and \ruleref{wsig/add}),
%\Zhixuan{Page 14: I don't see the necessity of introducing "enhanced W-types". Since there are already boolean types and Σ types, Fin types can be defined. Using Fin, ordinary W types suffice to define trees with n constructors. So it might be clearer to just define 'enhanced W-types' as syntactic sugar.}\YZreply{I concur.}\EDJreply{This following sentence has been replied to Zhixuan and he doesn't has further response: 1. We have to have enhanced W-type at \TT, that's for sure. Otherwise we (a). are too far away from the surface syntax because W-type itself only has one constructor all the time (b) this suggested encoding or syntactic sugar, since it interact with other connective like linkage (the Wrec is the interaction), so Wrec part is mostly unchanged  (c) since they will look the same, the encoding itself will look like an extra equality judgement in the syntax... which is not helpful for the complexity at all ... and even more complex  \\
%2. so to me the problem you guys really have is around the content in the appendix -- I think Zhixuan mean he doesn't think this is more expressive. But my point is, it is hard to really write out the above syntactic sugar, formally. I think the issue here is similar to other reviewer saying "syntax translation". It is very hard to write out the encoding of Fin already, and then encode it again into W-type. (Just ask my agda mechanization). Of course, some hand-waiving can be done. For example, the part Zhixuan says I think it okay to hand-wave. But the destruction part -- the part Wrec interact with this encoding, I don't believe handwaving is enough. \\
%3. But how do I say this to the audience? I mean the main reason I didn't choose syntactic translation/syntax sugar is basically ``doing encoding is harder than directly working in ambient logic.'' }
%
each modeling a constructor of the inductive type.
The $i$-th pair, projected from the signature~$\wsig$ using the forms
$\goodType{\Gm}{\wsigproj{i}{1}{\wsig}}{}$ and
$\goodTerm{\Gm}{\wsigproj{i}{2}{\wsig}}{\wsigproj{i}{1}{\wsig} \to \cU}$,
defines the $i$-th constructor.
That is, given two arguments $\goodTerm{\Gm}{t_1}{\wsigproj{i}{1}{\wsig}}$ and
$\goodTerm{\Gm, x : \El{\wsigproj{i}{2}{\wsig}(t_1)} }{t_2}{\El{\wcode{\wsig}}}$,
one can construct a term $\Wsup{i}{\wsig}{t_1}{x.t_2}$ of the W-type \El{\wcode{\wsig}} (\ruleref{tm/wsup}).
$\wcode{\wsig}$ gives the code of the
W-type (\ruleref{tm/w}).

For each pair of types identifying a constructor, the first type models
the non-inductive arguments of the constructor, and the second type models the \emph{arity}
of the inductive arguments.
For example, the signature~$\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ of the W-type modeling
the inductive type~\lsti{tm} (\cref{fig:stlc-mechanized})
is constructed as follows,
where $\bbzero$ is the bottom type~$\bot$, $\bbone$ the unit type~$\top$, $\bbtwo$ the boolean type,
and $T_{\texttt{id}}$ a type encoding~\lsti{id}:
%
\begin{align*}
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\lsti!tm_unit : tm!
&
\lsti!tm_var : id -> tm!
&
\lsti!tm_abs : id -> tm -> tm!
&
\lsti!tm_app : tm -> tm -> tm!
\smallskip\\
$\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^0 \coloneq \WSigAdd{\WSigEmp}{\bbone}{\lambda \_ . \bbzero}$ 
& $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1 \coloneq \WSigAdd{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^0}{T_{\texttt{id}}}{\lambda \_ . \bbzero}$
& $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^2 \coloneq \WSigAdd{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1}{T_{\texttt{id}}}{\lambda \_ .\bbone} $ 
& $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}} \coloneq \WSigAdd{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^2}{\bbone}{\lambda \_ .\bbtwo}$
\end{tabular}
\end{align*}

\noindent
While \lsti{tm_unit} and \lsti{tm_var} have no inductive arguments,
\lsti{tm_abs} has one and \lsti{tm_app} has two.
The encoding of \lsti{tm_abs} has type
$T_{\texttt{id}} \to (\bbone \to \El{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}) \to \El{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$,
and that of \lsti{tm_app} has type
$\bbone \to (\bbtwo \to \El{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}) \to \El{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$.
These types are strictly positive by construction.

%We illustrate the structure of W-type signature (as a list) here.
%$\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^0, \wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1$ are (the subparts of) the
%signatures of constructors \{"tm\_unit"\} and \{"tm\_unit","tm\_app"\}
%respectively. Each item in this W-type signature, having two types, corresponds
%to one constructor, where the first type stores the non-recursive part of the
%constructor and the second type stores the ``arity'' of the  recursive part. For
%example, the type of $"app" : ("tm" \to "tm" \to "tm")$ $\cong (\bbone \times
%(\bbtwo \to "tm") \to "tm")$, corresponds to the premise of rule
%\ruleref{tm/wsup} (where $\wsigproj{0}{1}{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1} = \bbone,
%\wsigproj{0}{2}{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1} = \lambda \_ . \bbtwo$). This type means
%there is no information on non-recursive part (thus use unit type $\bbone$) and
%the ``arity'' of the recursive part is $\bbtwo$ and thus $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^1
%= \WSigAdd{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^0}{\bbone}{\lambda \_ .\bbtwo}$.  The story is
%similar for $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}^0$, where there is no recursive part at all and
%thus the ``arity'' is zero.\YZ{Feels like it's more straightforward to just list
%the encodings of the four constructors of tm in a table, assuming an encoding of
%the identifier type. And this paragraph should be moved to the earlier paragraph
%on W-types. I'll take a stab at this.}
%
%Generally speaking, the expressiveness of W-types comes from the ``arity'', as
%it encodes the case when recursive structure stores as the output of a function,
%mirroring the strict positivity of Inductive type.

W-types are eliminated with the form $\Wrec{\wsig}{\lkg}{t}$, where $t$ is of a
W-type $\El{\wcode{\wsig}}$, and $\lkg$ is essentially an $n$-tuple of
case handlers for the $n$ constructors in~$\wsig$ (\ruleref{tm/wrec}).
Each case handler has a type of form $\CaseSig{A}{B}{T}$, where
$T$ is the motive of the recursion (\ruleref{tyeq/casety});
for simplicity, we model only non-dependent motives.
The collection of case handlers~$\lkg$ encodes those defined and inherited
by an \lsti{FRecursion} command in our plugin.
We choose to type it with a linkage type $\TyLkg{\RecSig{\wsig}{T}}$
to avoid introducing non-dependent $n$-tuples, which linkages generalize.

% We illustrate one concrete example in \cref{fig:Wtype-example} of a "tm" with only two constructors, 
% also as a review for how W-type encodes a given inductive type. The key insight 
% is, to encode one constructor into a pair $(\wsigproj{i}{1}{\wsig}, \wsigproj{i}{2}{\wsig})$, the non-recursive part will be stored in $\wsigproj{i}{1}{\wsig}$ 
% while the ``arity'' of the  recursive part stores in $\wsigproj{i}{2}{\wsig}$. 
% For example, $"app" : ("tm" \to "tm" \to "tm")$ 
% $\cong ((\bbtwo \to "tm") \to "tm")$, saying the ``arity'' of the recursive part is $\bbtwo$ 
% (or boolean type, as a type with two elements). Similarly, the ``arity'' of recursive part of "unit" is 0. 
% Both constructors don't store other information thus $\bbone$. We hightlight $\tau$ as the 
% signature of our "tm" and showcase the meta-theoretic encoding of "unit" and "app~unit~unit". $"elim-"\bbzero$ indicates the elimination of the bottom type $\bbzero$ in the context. Generally speaking, the expressiveness of W-types comes from the ``arity'', as it encodes the case when recursive structure stores as the output of a function, mirroring the strict positivity of Inductive type.


Rules \ruleref{tm/wsup} and \ruleref{tm/wrec} require access to~$\wsig$:
the W-type is exhaustively generated by its constructors, and
its elimination must exhaustively handle all the constructors in
its signature.

In contrast, $\wsig$ should be hidden from the typing context of any
term that does not invoke $\Wsup{}{\wsig}{\cDot}{\cDot}$ or $\Wrec{\wsig}{\cDot}{\cDot}$, so that
the term can be reused---without being rechecked---for a different
W-type signature~$\wsig'$ that extends~$\wsig$ with additional
constructors.
Moreover, the typing of the term should be made parametric to
the definitions of those fields that invoke $\texttt{Wsup}$ or $\texttt{Wrec}$,
so that the term can be reused---without being rechecked---when those fields
are overridden to support the extended signature~$\wsig'$.
%
Such abstraction required by family polymorphism is supported via linkages,
which we discuss next.


\noindentparagraph{Family polymorphism via linkages.}

Family polymorphism requires late binding.
In \TT, families are expressed through linkages, and late binding of
field references is achieved by requiring that typing be polymorphic to
the definition of that field.

\emph{Linkage signatures} have the form $\goodSig{\Gm}{\lsig}{n}$.
As rules \ruleref{lsig/empty} and \ruleref{lsig/add} show, a linkage
signature is a list of $n$~types.
%
\emph{Linkages} have the form $\goodTerm{\Gm}{\lkg}{\TyLkg{\lsig}}$,
where $\TyLkg{\lsig}$ is a type formed by~$\lsig$.
As rules \ruleref{l/empty} and \ruleref{l/add} show, a linkage is a list
of $n$~terms, each representing a field of the family modeled by the linkage.

In rules \ruleref{l/add} and \ruleref{lsig/add},
the second premise $\goodTerm{\Gm, \mathit{self} : A}{t}{T}$ is
responsible for late binding.
Here, $A$ abstracts the context of the current field~$t$, controlling
how the types of the fields prior to~$t$ are exposed to the typing of~$t$.
Crucially, %unlike the second field in a dependent pair (\ruleref{tm/pair}),
the premise $\goodTerm{\Gm, \mathit{self} : A}{t}{T}$ makes clear that
the typing of~$t$ in \ruleref{l/add} is \emph{universally} quantified---%
rather than \emph{existentially} quantified as is in \ruleref{tm/pair}---%
over how the fields in $t$'s context are defined.
Late binding enables reuse.
A different linkage~$\ell'$ that overrides fields in $t$'s context (and thus models a derived family)
can reuse~$t$---without retyping it---by first
projecting~$t$ from $\LkgAdd{\lkg}{\mathit{self}.t}$ and then appending it to~$\lkg'$.
%\EDJ{I suggest change this sentence to `by projecting it out of parent linkage and adding it in the derived linkage'}.

%recorded by the first premise $\goodTerm{\Gm}{\lkg}{\TyLkg{\lsig}}$
The type~$A$ in \ruleref{l/add} and \ruleref{lsig/add},
abstracting the types of the prior fields, does not necessarily contain the same types as those recorded by~$\TyLkg{\lsig}$,
%\EDJ{Suggest changing to ``not necessarily the same as those recorded by lsig in the prior fields''},
because a field defined as the code $\wcode{\wsig}$ of a W-type has to
expose different types to different fields that come after it.
Later fields that invoke
$\Wsup{}{\wsig}{\cDot}{\cDot}$ or $\Wrec{\wsig}{\cDot}{\cDot}$
should see the concrete signature~$\wsig$, as rules \ruleref{tm/wsup}
and \ruleref{tm/wrec} stipulate.
By contrast, $\wsig$ should be hidden
from all other fields, so that they can be reused
in a different context where the W-type signature~$\wsig$ is replaced by an extended one~$\wsig'$.

On the left is code excerpted from \cref{fig:stlc-mechanized}, and on the right

$\lkg_i$ is the linkage that adds the $i$-th field~$t_i$ with the typing

%in this typing judgment:
%we name the context as $\mathit{self}$ (cf.~\cref{fig:stlc-compiled})
%and write its type~$A_i$, which is a dependent tuple type, as a
%dependent record type with labels.
%
\begin{itemize}
% [leftmargin=4ex,itemsep=.5ex]
  [labelsep=*,leftmargin=1pc,itemsep=3pt]

\item 
The first field $t_1$ is defined as $\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}$
and given the singleton type $\TyS{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$, where $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$
is the W-type signature constructed earlier for the extensible inductive type~\lsti{tm}.
This typing is recorded by $\lsig_1$ and is thus available in all $\lsig_i$'s.

\item 
The next four fields model the four constructors of~\lsti{tm}.
Constructor \lsti{tm_unit} is modeled as $\Wsup{}{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}{\top}{x.\bot}$
and has type $\El{\getfield{\mathit{self}}{"tm"}}$, where $\mathit{self}$ stands for
the typing context containing the first field~\lsti{tm}.
The W-type signature $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ is exposed in
this typing context; that is, $\getfield{\mathit{self}}{"tm"}$ has type $\TyS{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$.
So $\El{\getfield{\mathit{self}}{"tm"}}$ and $\El{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$ can be equated,
as required by rule \ruleref{tm/wsup}.

\item
Likewise, $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ is exposed in the typing context of
$t_{10}$, which models the recursive function \lsti{subst} by invoking
the recursor $\Wrec{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}{\cDot}{\cDot}$.
%
Like \lsti{subst}, partial recursors in \Lang are axiomatized by the plugin
(\cref{sec:latebind,sec:prec}), and they can similarly be defined in \TT
using $\texttt{Wrec}$.

\item
By contrast, $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ is hidden from the typing of all other fields.
Their typing should depend on the knowledge that \lsti!tm! has type~$\cU$,
rather than \TyS{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}},
so that they can be reused in a context where
\lsti!tm! is defined as $\wcode{\wsig'_{\texttt{tm}}}$,
where $\wsig'_{\texttt{tm}}$ extends~$\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ with additional constructors.
%
For example, in \cref{fig:stlc-linkage-typing}, the typing of the case handlers of
\lsti{subst} (e.g., $t_6$) is oblivious to the definition of \lsti!tm!---it sees only $\text{\lsti!tm!}:\cU$---so
the case handlers can be reused by a linkage modeling \lsti{STLCFix}.

\end{itemize}

In rules \ruleref{l/add} and \ruleref{lsig/add},
the third premise $\goodTerm{\Gm,x : \TyTkg{\lsig}}{\seal}{A}$ is
responsible for hiding W-type signatures.
Here, $\TyTkg{\lsig}$ packages $\lsig$---recall that $\lsig$ contains the
(self-parameterized) types of all the fields preceding the current
field~$t$---into a dependent tuple type (\ruleref{tyeq/pk/add}).
The term $\seal$ turns a tuple of type $\TyTkg{\lsig}$ into a new tuple of type~$A$
that hides W-type signatures behind $\cU$, if necessary.\footnote{%
In the presence of hiding, it is important that the context type~$A$ be a
dependent tuple type rather than a linkage type; we expand on this point in an
appendix.}

It is straightforward to find the~$\seal$ that fits the bill, though this process
is not automated in \TT.
In particular, when no hiding is needed (that is, when the field being checked
invokes a W-type constructor or eliminator), $\seal$ is simply~$x$,
and $A$ is $\TyTkg{\lsig}$.
In \cref{fig:stlc-linkage-typing}, $\seal_2$ and $\seal_{10}$ are~$x$.
%\EDJ{$\var{0}$ is not identity (substitution), but the first variable, right? Or you meant to say it is identity ``sealing''?}\YZreply{Yes, I meant identity sealing. I cannot say 'sealing' because the paper currently does not use the word sealing anywhere.}\EDJreply{What about just remove the parenthesis and ``the identity''}
Otherwise, it is needed to hide W-type signatures. In \cref{fig:stlc-linkage-typing},
$\seal_6$ hides $"tm" : \TyS{\wcode{\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}}}$
as $"tm" : \cU$ in~$A_6$,
so that~$t_6$, typed under $\mathit{self}:A_6$, is oblivious to the concrete signature
$\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ and therefore can be reused.

When a family is concluded (e.g., \lsti!End!~\lsti!STLC!),
a linkage~$\lkg$ containing all the fields is available
(e.g., $\lkg_{53}$ in \cref{fig:stlc-linkage-typing}).
Fields of the family can then be accessed by projecting them out of the tuple
$\Tkg{\lkg}$.
As \ruleref{tmeq/pk/add} indicates, $\Tkg{\lkg}$ ties the recursive knot:
it packages the linkage~$\lkg$ into a dependent tuple of type~$\TyTkg{\lsig}$,
by instantiating the $\mathit{self}$ parameters.


\noindentparagraph{Linkage transformers.}

Inheritance and code reuse can already be expressed through the projection
of fields out of linkages and their inclusion into new linkages.
To make common patterns of linkage manipulations more convenient,
\TT provides a ``library'' of \emph{linkage transformers}, whose well-formedness judgments
have form $\goodInh{\Gm}{h}{\lsig_1}{\lsig_2}$. The idea is that
applying~$h$ to a linkage of type~$\TyLkg{\lsig_1}$ yields a linkage of
type~$\TyLkg{\lsig_2}$ (\ruleref{tm/inh}).
%Linkage transformers are second-class; the only way to use them is to
%apply them to linkages to form new linkages.

Derived families can be modeled as linkage transformers inductively
constructed from the introduction forms
$\small\InhId$, $\small\InhExt{h}{\mathit{self}.t}$, $\small\InhOv{h}{\mathit{self}.t}$, %$\small\InhInh{h}$,
etc.
\cref{fig:fmltt-selected} shows the $\beta$-rule of an exemplary transformer,
\ruleref{tmeq/ov/beta}.
It states that applying the transformer $\small\InhOv{h}{\mathit{self}_{\!2}.t_2}$ to
a linkage of form $\LkgAdd{\lkg}{\mathit{self}_{\!1}.t_1}$
overrides the linkage's last field~$t_1$ with~$t_2$.
For instance, the construction below shows that 
$\small\InhOv{\InhId}{\mathit{self}'\!.\wcode{\wsig'_{\texttt{tm}}}}$
is used as the first step in creating a linkage transformer modeling a derived family that
overrides $\wsig_{\texttt{tm}}$ with an extended
signature~$\wsig'_{\texttt{tm}}$:

This definitive version uses de Bruijn indices and explicit substitution.
An effort to mechanize the formalization is underway. It follows \citet{altkap2016}
in using quotient inductive-inductive types (QIITs) as 
the logical framework to state intrinsically typed syntax (and also
in using Agda's \lsti{REWRITE} pragma to replace the limited uses of equality
reflection, as Agda does not support QIITs natively).
