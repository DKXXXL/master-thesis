In this section, we start by introducing the complete formulation of the syntax of \TT, 
and then we detail the proofs for syntactic translation (that translate away linkages), 
consistency and canonicity.

\subsection{Warm Up: Review Declarative MLTT}
We start with introduction to MLTT as \TT can be roughly considered as MLTT with linkages.
