In this section, we start by introducing the complete formulation of the syntax of \TT, 
and then we detail the proofs for syntactic translation (that translate away linkages), 
consistency and canonicity. 

\subsection{Warm Up: Review Declarative MLTT}
We start with introduction to MLTT as \TT can be roughly considered as MLTT with linkages.
We work in an intrinsic-typed setting, so there is no un-typed preterms.

\subsection{\TT : an MLTT variant with Linkages}
Compared to MLTT, \TT has 3 more judgements about signatures and linkage transformers.
